The following values are always falsy:
false
0 (zero)
'' or "" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (e.g. the result of 1/0)

Everything else is truthy. That includes:
'0' (a string containing a single zero)
'false' (a string containing the text “false”)
[] (an empty array)
{} (an empty object)
function(){} (an “empty” function)

Any operator can be said to have four characteristics:
Its arity: how many operands the operator accepts
Its function: what the operator does with its operands and what it evaluates to
Its precedence: how the operator will be grouped when used in combination
with other operators
Its associativity: how the operator will behave when neighbored with operators
of the same precedence
